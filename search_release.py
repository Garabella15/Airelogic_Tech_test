Lyrics = """ 
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
(Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never lived to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if its true
If it's you, what you say in your raps is what you do
So they feel, it's part of ya obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, you can conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
I love pissin' you off, it get's me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'm violatin' all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch is news
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better, 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em then come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in your wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits as soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody's hearts just stop, they call the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' at the Hot Rock's parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not 'cause
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I can do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
